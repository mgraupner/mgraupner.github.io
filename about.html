        <p>Hi, I'm Michael and I'm an independent systems engineer. With over 15 years of experience, I help companies build successful software projects.
          My extensive knowledge of IT systems covers every aspect of their development, from start to finish.</p>
        <p>My primary objective is to develop systems that are user friendly and easy to understand. I prioritise the timely and cost-effective
          delivery of these systems and enjoy a minimalist approach to design.</p>
        <h3>Working with me</h3>
        <p>As a freelance system and software engineer, I pride myself on clear and concise communication. I keep clients informed throughout
          the development process, actively listen to their needs, and explain technical concepts in a way that's easy to understand.
          While I excel at working independently, I'm also a strong team player when needed. I can adapt my approach to different project
          dynamics, offering leadership when a project requires direction or seamlessly integrating into existing teams. My commitment
          to continuous learning ensures I'm always up-to-speed on the latest technologies, allowing me to tackle new challenges with
          flexibility and enthusiasm.</p>
