        <p>I am most enthusiastic about projects that allow me to contribute from the outset to the final delivery.</p>
        <p>Here are some recent examples of how I've helped to make these happen:</p>

          <h3 class="">Going from paper to the future</h3>
          <p><a href="https://elko-schmid.de" target="_blank">Elko Schmid in Zwickau</a>
            needed a future-proof and ISO 9001-compliant way of ensuring the quality of its products. In 2021 they asked me to develop a
            new production management and control system. This system consists of several modules, ranging from an interface to their ERP system
            to views for managing the production process and monitoring the quality process.</p>
          <p>Each worker is equipped with his own tablet on which he can control production progress and enter data required for quality management.</p>
          <p>The system is independent from the operating system and runs on Linux servers, Windows clients, Android tablets and a Raspberry Pi.</p>
          <p>Since it's initial launch, the system has been expanded with several new modules and is contributing to the company's continued success.</p>

          <h3 class="">Transforming mobility</h3>
          <p><a href="https://de.mer.eco" target="_blank">When Mer Germany GmbH (former E-WALD GmbH) in Teisnach</a>
            launched their business, they hoped to bring mobility into the 21st century. They did this by launching two groundbreaking services, the
            introduction of e-car charging stations in rural areas and e-car sharing. I was involved in both services from the beginning.</p>
          <p>I created a monitoring service to guarantee the uptime of these chargers, made them work in a secure environment inside of VPNs, connected them via LTE in remote areas and moved the incident management into Jira so that everyone involved could access the data in a structured way. To make them more resilient and indepenent from the manufacturers, I implemented a custom proxy system these chargers connected to and passed the data to the final backend. This opened up a lot of possibilities for creating new services.</p>
          <p>For the e-car sharing I built the entire software stack, front-end (responsive and usable on mobile and desktop) and back-end, the connection to the e-car sharing platform provider and administrative tools for the employees involved. This platform has generated tens of thousands of bookings and is still in use after over 8 years (at a new owner).</p>
          <p>My services have been crucial to the growth of the business and supported all their IT operations until 2023.</p>

          <h3 class="">Transforming mobility - part 2</h3>
          <p>One particularly interesting project was the <a href="https://www.owlmobil.info/linien-e-carsharing/" target="_blank">city of Borgholzhausen's eCarsharing</a> project in Germany. This town has a train station outside the town centre and wanted to enable passengers to travel to the centre and other outlying parts of the town by electric car (like a bus line, but whenever the user wanted and driven by themselves), thus reducing the need to burn fossil fuels.</p>
            <p>I was responsible for implementing the software to do this. I created a responsive app that allowed the user to book the cars and manage their bookings. The hard part was adding this functionality to an existing model that was not very flexible and working with a lot of stakeholders with different needs. In the end we were successful and usage is growing steadily, with hundreds of bookings per month.</p>
            <p>Traditional car sharing (with electric cars) and ride-sharing solutions have also been added to the range of transport options available. The solution also included software for the staff to manage the cars and their bookings.
            In the middle of the project we had to switch the car-sharing platform to a new provider, which was a challenging project on its own but also went smoothly.</p>
