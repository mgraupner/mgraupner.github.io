        <p>I am most enthusiastic about projects that allow me to contribute from the outset to the final delivery.</p>
        <p>Here are some recent examples of how I've helped to make these happen:</p>

          <h3 class="">Going from paper to the future</h3>
          <p><a href="https://elko-schmid.de" target="_blank">Elko Schmid in Zwickau</a>
            needed a future-proof and ISO 9001-compliant way of ensuring the quality of its products. In 2021 they asked me to develop a
            new production management and control system. This system consists of several modules, ranging from an interface to their ERP system
            to views for managing the production process and monitoring the quality process.</p>
          <p>Each worker is equipped with his own tablet on which he can control production progress and enter data required for quality management.</p>
          <p>The system is independent from the operating system and runs on Linux servers, Windows clients, Android tablets and a Raspberry Pi.</p>
          <p>Since it's initial launch, the system has been expanded with several new modules and is contributing to the company's continued success.</p>

          <h3 class="">Transforming mobility</h3>
          <p><a href="https://de.mer.eco" target="_blank">When Mer Germany GmbH (former E-WALD GmbH) in Teisnach</a>
            launched their business, they hoped to bring mobility into the 21st century. They did this by launching two groundbreaking services, the
            introduction of e-car charging stations in rural areas and e-car sharing. I was involved in both services from the beginning.</p>
          <p>I created a monitoring service to guarantee the uptime of these chargers, made them work in a secure environment inside of VPNs, connected them via LTE in remote areas and moved the incident management into Jira so that everyone involved could access the data in a structured way. To make them more resilient and indepenent from the manufacturers, I implemented a custom proxy system these chargers connected to and passed the data to the final backend. This opened up a lot of possibilities for creating new services.</p>
          <p>For the e-car sharing I built the entire software stack, front-end (responsive and usable on mobile and desktop) and back-end, the connection to the e-car sharing platform and administrative tools for the employees involved. This platform has generated tens of thousands of bookings and is still in use after over 8 years (at a new owner).</p>
          <p>My services have been crucial to the growth of the business and supported all their IT operations until 2023.</p>
