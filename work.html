        <p>I am most enthusiastic about projects that allow me to contribute from the outset to the final delivery.</p>
        <p>Here are some recent examples of how I've helped to make these happen:</p>

          <h3 class="">Going from paper to the future</h3>
          <p><a href="https://elko-schmid.de" target="_blank">Elko Schmid in Zwickau</a>
            needed a future-proof and ISO 9001-compliant way of ensuring the quality of its products. In 2021 they asked me to develop a
            new production management and control system. This system consists of several modules, ranging from an interface to their ERP system
            to views for managing the production process and monitoring the quality process.</p>
          <p>Each worker is equipped with his own tablet on which he can control production progress and enter data required for quality management.</p>
          <p>The system is independent from the operating system and runs on Linux servers, Windows clients, Android tablets and a Raspberry Pi.</p>
          <p>Since it's initial launch, the system has been expanded with several new modules and is contributing to the company's continued success.</p>

          <h3 class="">Transforming mobility</h3>
          <p><a href="https://de.mer.eco" target="_blank">When Mer Germany GmbH (former E-WALD GmbH) in Teisnach</a>
            launched their business, they were hoping to transform mobility to the 21st century. They did this by launching two services, ecar charging
            stations and ecar sharing. I was involved in both services from the beginning.</p>
          <p>Since it's initial launch, the system has been expanded with several new modules and is contributing to the company's continued success.</p>
